    Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETD)}

\begin{center}
    \textbf{University of Houston Electronic Thesis/Disseratation Policy}
\end{center}

\noindent All Electronic Theses/Dissertations (ETDs) will be made available after graduation on the internet via the University of Houston Libraries and through ProQuest. Availability may be delayed temporarily for circumstances such as patent consideration, compliance with research contractual terms, publication issues, etc, by requesting an embargo.

\bigskip

\noindent\textbf{What comprises an ETD record?}

\noindent An ETD record includes the elements, as noted below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Metadata} – Data which describe the ETD record. These include, but are not limited to, the title, abstract, author, committee, keywords, etc.
    \item \textbf{Full Text Document}– The ETD primary document which describes the independent research study that was undertaken to partially fulfill requirements for the degree sought – generally a single PDF file.
    \item \textbf{Supplemental files} – Files which accompany the ETD document, are intended for public access, and provide additional details of the research (e.g., data sets, movie clips, etc.).
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\noindent\textbf{What is an embargo?}

\noindent If needed, a student can request, with the support of their committee chair, that the full text of their ETD by held back from release for a two-year period following graduation. This is generally for students pursuing a patent, or working toward publication of material in an academic journal. During the two-year embargo, only the metadata of the document is seen publicly, attesting to the existence of the ETD, but the full text is withheld.

\bigskip

\noindent\textbf{What is a "Full Record Hold," and when would I choose it?}

\noindent If you need the full ETD record to be withheld from public access due to patent considerations or to comply with research contractual terms, select the "Full Record Hold" on the Special Circumstance form. The ETD record will not be viewable publicly during the embargo period and will only be released after the embargo period ends.

\bigskip

\noindent\textbf{How do I extend an embargo hold?}

\noindent A hold may be extended for up to two years (for the first extension) and then one year at a time for any additional extensions. The request must be made prior to expiration and appropriate justification must be included. Each request for extension will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Please complete and submit the "Special Circumstance" form.

\bigskip

\noindent Graduate students and faculty (when sponsored research) bear responsibility for requesting extensions. A timely response is important in order to extend the hold period. The full ETD record will be released following the expiration date if no response is received.

\bigskip

\noindent For additional questions or concerns regarding availability options, please contact The Graduate School at gradschool@uh.edu.
